BUAA Satellite Image Dataset (BUAA-SID1.0)

BUAA-SID1.0 contains gray and binary images of 20 satellites name in format
SatelliteName+####.bmp for gray images and A_+SatelliteName+####.bmp for
binary images.

Ground truth pose angles (viewpoints) are in the mat file named SID1.0_GT.mat,
where the first column is pitch and the last column is yaw.
The unit of all angles in BUAA-SID1.0 is DEGREE.

This dataset is made available for non-commercial use such as research and ducation.
